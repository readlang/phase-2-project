## Flatiron School phase 2 project
This is a goal tracking app created using React.  

<br>

The app works with the following steps:
* A user would arrive to the site on Home page.  This would be the location of a future log-in feature.  
* On the Goal page, a user can enter goals using a "mad libs" style entry form, where individual pieces of the goal are entered into a form, such as the goal title, the activity, whether it's an "at least" or an "at most" goal, the target number, etc.  A goal can then be saved from this form.
* On the Log page, activities can be added which contribute to meeting the previously set goals.  Activities are logged and saved one by one.
* On the Track page, the goals are displayed, and once a goal is selected, the associated activities are displayed as well.  At the bottom of this page a tracker displaying the previous 14 days are shown, which a graphical representation of whether activities were recorded for that date.  There are also some summary items displayed.  

<br>
Currently the app is step up to work with JSON-server on the local machine for the data persistance.  In future versions I may deploy this to an online hosted database.  

<br>

To use the app, clone the repository to your local machine.  Also visit  
https://github.com/readlang/json-server-template for the repository of the JSON-server.  

Thank you for your interest in this app.
